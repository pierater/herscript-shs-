Students will follow the instructors in an image manipulation program, written in python. The structure of the session will be as follows:
    - Show example program, filter1.py, on the projector. Explain what each line of code is doing. 
    - Open the python interpreter and run filter1.py.
    - Have students open the myFilter1.py.
    - Have students follow you as you code filter1.py in the myFilter1.py file.
    - Remember to go through it slowly and stop for questions. 
    - Once finished, have students open the python interpreter and run myFilter1.py program.
    - If time allows, lead students through myFilter2.py and myFilter3.py.
